# tinyRayTracer
a CPU Ray Tracing algorithm in C++

This project is a CPU-based ray tracer, meaning:
- It does not use OpenGL / Vulkan / GPU
- It simulates light physics mathematically
- It renders a 3D scene by shooting rays from a camera into the scene
- The output is a static image (PPM file)

Conceptually, it answers this question:
“For each pixel on the screen, what color should it be if light behaved like this?”
